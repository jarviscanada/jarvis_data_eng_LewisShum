jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Utilizing a combination of a Bash Script and Crontab, coupled with a centralized PostgreSQL server hosted on Docker, the Linux cluster monitoring application provides real-time visibility into server hardware usage. This comprehensive approach guarantees not only optimal performance but also swift issue resolution. Continuous, up-to-the-minute monitoring of server health and resource utilization empowers system administrators with the tools they need to maintain server uptime, proactively address potential issues, and efficiently allocate resources.

highlighted_projects:
  - name: "Solve TSP With GA"
    git_url: "https://github.com/lewis0926/genetic-algorithm-tsp"
    description: This project presents an implementation of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to tackle the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Developed in Python within Jupyter Notebook environments, the project draws upon a suite of essential libraries, including numpy for efficient data manipulation, matplotlib for insightful data visualization, pandas for data handling, and sklearn for algorithmic implementations. Beyond its technical prowess, this project serves the dual purpose of solving a classical TSP and showcasing the broader potential applications of efficient route optimization, ranging from logistics and supply chain management to network routing and beyond.
  - name: "Train MLP With GA"
    git_url: "https://github.com/lewis0926/train-mlp-with-ga"
    description: This project, developed within a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python, implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to fine-tune a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Leveraging a stack of essential libraries, including numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for data visualization, mlxtend for machine learning model evaluation, pickle for object serialization, and scikit-learn (sklearn) for comprehensive machine learning tools, this endeavor facilitates efficient data preprocessing, model training, and genetic algorithm optimization. The combined power of these libraries empowers data scientists and machine learning practitioners to craft and optimize MLP architectures effectively. Notably, this project explores an alternative approach to training MLP models, diverging from the standard backpropagation method, showcasing the versatility of GA-based optimization in neural network architecture design.
