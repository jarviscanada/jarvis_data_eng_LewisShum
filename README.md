# Lewis Shum . Jarvis Consulting

I hold an MSc in Information Technology with Distinction from Hong Kong Polytechnic University. During my tenure at Prudential plc, a multinational insurance company, I worked within a regional team, supporting Local Business Units in countries like Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia. This role honed my communication skills, allowing me to effectively collaborate across various countries and departments. I possess proficiency in multiple programming languages (Typescript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Java, C#), both relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases, as well as familiarity with DevOps tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git. My passion lies in software engineering, where I take pleasure in creating reliable, scalable, and well-organized applications while eagerly staying current with emerging technologies in the field. With my robust educational foundation, a blend of technical and soft skills, and my commitment to continuous growth, I believe I can make a valuable contribution to your team.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_LewisShum/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Linux cluster monitoring application offers real-time insight into server hardware usage, ensuring optimal performance and timely issue resolution. It operates through a bash script triggered at regular intervals by a crontab, which writes new records to a centralized SQL server. This approach enables continuous, up-to-the-minute monitoring of server health and resource utilization. This Linux cluster monitoring application is a valuable tool for system administrators, ensuring server uptime, preemptive issue resolution, and efficient resource allocation.


## Highlighted Projects
**Train MLP With GA** [[GitHub](https://github.com/lewis0926/train-mlp-with-ga)]: This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to fine-tune a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. It's coded in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging various libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and genetic algorithm optimization.

**Solve TSP With GA** [[GitHub](https://github.com/lewis0926/genetic-algorithm-tsp)]: This project is an implementation of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The code is written in Python within Jupyter Notebook environments and utilizes several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and algorithmic implementations.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2023-present)**: In my role at Jarvis, my primary focus is app development, and the Linux Cluster Monitoring App is one of my projects. This versatile tool provides real-time server insights, helping system administrators optimize resources and proactively resolve issues to ensure server uptime and efficiency.

**Software Engineer, Prudential plc (2022-2023)**: In my role at Prudential, I excelled in delivering high-quality work within tight timelines in an Agile Scrum environment. My focus primarily revolved around Full Stack development, with a strong emphasis on Back-End (BE) development. Leveraging cutting-edge DevOps and Cloud tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and Azure, I streamlined our software development processes. Communication played a vital role in my daily tasks as I collaborated with a diverse team of 50 professionals across 7 international business units within our regional development team. I was responsible for overseeing and contributing to the development of various projects across more than 20 distinct Git branches, each tailored to specific business units. My expertise extended to Full Stack development, with Node.js and TypeScript powering the Back-End and React driving the Front-End, ensuring a comprehensive approach to software development. Additionally, I conducted thorough code reviews and merged push requests from fellow developers to uphold code quality and enhance team collaboration.

**Programmer, Fujifilm Data Management Solutions (2020-2022)**: In my role at Fujifilm, I played a pivotal role in the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), encompassing planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment of software solutions. As a key contributor, I led the resolution of critical production issues by fostering close collaboration with clients and internal teams, ensuring clear and effective communication throughout the process. My responsibilities also involved collecting requirements from clients within the finance sector and establishing protocols and methods to ensure that technical solutions aligned seamlessly with their strategic objectives. My core expertise lay in utilizing C#.NET as the Back-End language, and I gained valuable experience in Linux environments, further enhancing my contribution to the team and the successful delivery of projects.
